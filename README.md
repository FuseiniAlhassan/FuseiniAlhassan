# 💫 Hi 👋, I'm Alhassan Kpahambang Fuseini
✨**Heart for Science, Love for Physics:** Driven by curiosity, powered by discovery.

💡 **I’m a passionate physics researcher and aspiring graduate student exploring the intersections of optics, photonics, condensed matter, and computational physics. My projects often combine physics with machine learning 🤖, simulations 🎥, and visualization 📊 to tackle complex problems and create practical applications.**

**🔭 Current interests:**

**🌐 Digital holography & wavefront reconstruction**

**🧱 Quantum materials & condensed matter theory**.

**🤖 Physics-informed deep learning**

**🛠️ Coding projects that bridge theory with real-world applications**

**✨ My goal is to build research-driven, open-source projects that inspire collaboration and advance learning in physics and engineering.**

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Cloaking and Invisibilty which involves developing simulation framworks, visualization tools, and reconstruction algorithms to study how light can be guided around objects and how hidden onformation can be retrieved, exploring ultrasound analogies for wave redirection , scattering suppression and "perfect cloak" designs that combine optical and acoustic wave physics.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** 💻 Full-stack web development with the goal of creating my own online platform for physics education and research. This platform will host interactive animations, simulations, diagrams, and problem-solving tools designed to support both tertiary and high school students, while also serving as a resource hub for physics researchers and the wider scientific community.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** 🤝 Projects at the intersection of optics, photonics, holography, and computational physics. I’m also open to collaborations that combine machine learning with physics simulations, as well as educational platforms that make advanced physics concepts accessible through interactive visualizations, animations, and problem-solving tools.
- 🤔🛠️ **I’m looking for help with:** advancing my projects on digital holography, cloaking simulations, and wavefront reconstruction—particularly in integrating deep learning and computational methods to push the boundaries of what these technologies can achieve. I also seek guidance on building scalable physics education platforms, where I can merge web development, simulations, and visualization tools to support both students and researchers.
-  💡💬 **Ask me about:** Collaborations or digital holography, wave optics, transformation optics, cloaking physics, deep learning for scientific imaging, and general physics education technologies. I enjoy bridging theory with computation, and I’m always open to discussing how physics concepts can be visualized through simulations, animations, and interactive platforms.

🌍 **Heart for Science, Love for Physics:** Building bridges between knowledge, technology, and society.

🚀 **Heart for Science, Love for Physics** Turning ideas into simulations, innovations, and learning platforms.
- 🌀 **Fun fact:** To me, coding feels like wave interference, sometimes constructive, sometimes destructive but physics is always the best lens to reveal the hidden beauty of the universe.
